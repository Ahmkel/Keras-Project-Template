# Getting Started
This template allows you to simply build and train deep learning models with checkpoints and tensorboard visualization.

In order to use the template you have to:
1. Define a data loader class.
2. Define a model class that inherits from BaseModel.
3. Define a trainer class that inherits.
4. Define a configuration file with the parameters needed in an experiment.
5. Run the model using:
```shell
python main.py -c [path to configuration file]
```

# Running The Demo Project
A simple model for the mnist dataset is available to test the template.
To run the demo project:
1. Start the training using:
```shell
python main.py -c configs/simple_mnist_config.json
```
2. Start Tensorboard visualization using:
```shell
tensorboard --logdir=experiments/%Y-%m-%d/simple_mnist/logs
```

# Comet.ml Integration
This template also supports reporting to Comet.ml which allows you to see all your hyper-params, metrics, graphs, dependencies and more including real-time metric.

Add your API key [in the configuration file](configs/simple_mnist_config.json#L15):


For example:  `"comet_api_key": "your key here"`

Here's how it looks after you start training:

You can also link your Github repository to your comet.ml project for full version control.

## Main Components

### Models
You need to:
1. Create a model class that inherits from **BaseModel**.
2. Override the ***build_model*** function which defines your model.
3. Call ***build_model*** function from the constructor.


### Trainers
You need to:
1. Create a trainer class that inherits from **BaseTrainer**.
2. Override the ***train*** function which defines the training logic.

**Note:** To add functionalities after each training epoch such as saving checkpoints or logs for tensorboard using Keras callbacks:
1. Declare a callbacks array in your constructor.
2. Define an ***init_callbacks*** function to populate your callbacks array and call it in your constructor.
3. Pass the callbacks array to the ***fit*** function on the model object.

**Note:** You can use ***fit_generator*** instead of ***fit*** to support generating new batches of data instead of loading the whole dataset at one time.

### Data Loaders
You need to:
1. Create a data loader class that inherits from **BaseDataLoader**.
2. Override the ***get_train_data()*** and the ***get_test_data()*** functions to return your train and test dataset splits.

**Note:** You can also define a different logic where the data loader class has a function ***get_next_batch*** if you want the data reader to read batches from your dataset each time.

### Configs
You need to define a .json file that contains your experiment and model configurations such as the experiment name, the batch size, and the number of epochs.


### Main
Responsible for building the pipeline.
1. Parse the config file
2. Create an instance of your data loader class.
3. Create an instance of your model class.
4. Create an instance of your trainer class.
5. Train your model using ".Train()" function on the trainer object.

### From Config
We can now load models without having to explicitly create an instance of each class. Look at:
1. from_config.py: this can load any config file set up to point to the right modules/classes to import
2. Look at configs/simple_mnist_from_config.json to get an idea of how this works from the config. Run it with:
```shell
python from_config.py -c configs/simple_mnist_from_config.json
```
3. See conv_mnist_from_config.json (and the additional data_loader/model) to see how easy it is to run a different experiment with just a different config file:
```shell
python from_config.py -c configs/conv_mnist_from_config.json
```

# Example Projects
* [Toxic comments classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and Word Embedding](https://github.com/Ahmkel/Toxic-Comments-Competition-Kaggle)


# Future Work
Create a command line tool for Keras project scaffolding where the user defines a data loader, a model, a trainer and runs the tool to generate the whole project. (This is somewhat complete now by loading each of these from the config)
